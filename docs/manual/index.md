# Welcome to JURASSIC!

The Juelich Rapid Spectral Simulation Code (JURASSIC) is a fast infrared radiative transfer model for the analysis of atmospheric remote sensing measurements.

## Features

These are some of the most important features of the JURASSIC model:

* JURASSIC uses the emissivity growth approximation (EGA) to conduct the radiative transfer calculations. Band transmittances are obtained from pre-calculated look-up tables from line-by-line calculations.
* The model was carefully tested in intercomparisons with the Karlsruhe Optimized and Precise Radiative Transfer Algorithm (KOPRA), the Reference Forward Model (RFM), and the Stand-alone AIRS Radiative Transfer Algorithm (SARTA).
* JURASSIC features an MPI-OpenMP hybrid parallelization for efficient use on HPC systems.
